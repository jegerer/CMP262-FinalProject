# CMP262-FinalProject
## Analysis of BeerAdvocate.com Review Data Set

For the final project for the Spring 2023 semester, an analysis of User Review data scraped from the website BeerAdvocate.com (via Kaggle) was performed. The motivation for this analysis was to investigate how different breweries and styles of beer were reviewed and examine the different taste profile descriptors that were included in the survey of reviews for each beer. The data set included over 5,500 reviews for beers from over 110 breweries.
